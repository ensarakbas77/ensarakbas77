## 🚀 About Me

I'm a 4th-year Information Systems Engineering student at Kocaeli University
with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

I have worked on end-to-end machine learning projects, covering data preprocessing,
model training, evaluation, and deployment, with particular interest in NLP
applications such as text classification and semantic similarity, as well as
computer vision workflows.

Currently, I focus on strengthening my technical skills by building hands-on
projects and experimenting with modern machine learning and deep learning
techniques.
